## [7.2.0] - 2026-10-28

- Mono-version fleet alignment: the whole zuraffa family now ships at the same version as the core.
- `zuraffa` dependency constraint unified to ^7.2.0 across the fleet.
- zuraffa_storage now wraps the maintained `zuraffa_minio` fork instead of the abandoned `minio` package (xml 7 compatible).
- Fleet-wide `dependency_overrides: xml: 7.1.0` policy; README install guides refreshed to the release version.

# Changelog

## 1.0.1

- `zuraffa` constraint raised to `^7.0.0` and `zorphy_annotation` to `^2.4.3`,
  so the package resolves alongside zuraffa 7.x consumers. No API changes.

## 1.0.0

- First published release: typed file picking for the Zuraffa ecosystem,
  built on zuraffa ^6.2.2.
- Pure-Dart `FilePickerPort` (`pickFiles` / `saveFile` / `pickDirectory`)
  with a scripted in-memory default adapter so picker flows test without a
  platform; dismissal is an empty result / null path, never an exception.
- `FilePickerService` facade (typed `missing_allowed_extensions` error),
  `PickFilesUseCase` (Zuraffa use case with cancellation), and a
  `registerFilePickerDependencies(GetIt)` composition root with a
  platform port factory wired by the adapters at startup.
- Zorphy `PickedFile` entity (copyWith, equality, JSON).
- Federated platform adapters: `zuraffa_file_picker_android` (Storage
  Access Framework, cached copies for readable paths),
  `zuraffa_file_picker_ios` (UIDocumentPickerViewController, iOS 14+),
  `zuraffa_file_picker_macos` (NSOpenPanel / NSSavePanel, macOS 11+).
